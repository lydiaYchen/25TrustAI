##  <a name='Coursedescription'></a>Course description
[TBD]Artificial Intelligent models systems the integrated part of our daily life. 

[TBD] The aim of this seminar course is to let students learn how to understand, design and build trustworthy AI systems via paper reproducing and extensiong.  We provide a broad overview on the design of the state-of-the-art Trustworthy AI models and systems, with a strong focus generative AI and reinforcement learning systems. 
 
 
The course materials will be based on a mixture of classic and recently published papers. The first 3-4 lectures, the basic concept of distributed machine learning will be covered, followed by six weeks of individual group advising, and then student group will present their project outcomes in the last three weeks.


##  <a name='Paper List'></a>Course assessment


Paper reading, reproducing and improvement  are the key activities in this course. To pass the course, you need to fulfill the following obligation
